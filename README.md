# Semantic Segmentation On Hyperspectral Images

This repository contains implementations and results of various deep learning models applied to hyperspectral image analysis, specifically for semantic segmentation tasks. The models include UNet, DeepLab, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with different band selection techniques, such as Maximum Relevance - Minimize Redudndancy (mRMR) and Deflection Coefficient.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name.git
   cd your_repo_name
      ```
   
2. Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Ensure you have the required datasets in the specified format before running the scripts.

## Usage
### Training a Model: 
To train a specific model, use the corresponding script:
```bash
python <model_name>.py
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To perform EDA on the dataset:
```bash
python eda.py --dataset <path_to_dataset>
```

## Results and Analysis
Performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, IoU, and other relevant metrics are stored in the /results directory.
Detailed comparative analysis of the models is presented in the associated research paper (R_D_paper.pdf).
